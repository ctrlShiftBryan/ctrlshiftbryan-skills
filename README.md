# ctrlshiftbryan-skills

Bryan's personal Claude Code plugins and skills.

## Plugins

| Plugin | Components | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`ralph`](plugins/ralph) | commands · skill · agent | Install and run the Ralph Wiggum agentic loop (claude/codex) in any project — adds `once.sh`/`afk.sh`, package scripts, and prompt/state scaffolding. |
| [`manual-chrome-review`](plugins/manual-chrome-review) | skill | Verify a running web app in a real Chrome session — user drives keyboard/mouse, Claude inspects DOM/network/WebSocket/server state. |
| [`pr-review-html`](plugins/pr-review-html) | skill | Generate a single-file interactive HTML code-review artifact for a GitHub PR (collapsible diffs, severity chips, per-finding checkboxes, feedback-prompt builder). |
| [`review-address`](plugins/review-address) | skill | Reply to every PR review comment (GitHub Copilot, bots, humans) with code fixes or reasoned push-backs, committing and posting an inline reply to each. |
| [`figma-fetcher`](plugins/figma-fetcher) | agent | Auto-delegating Haiku sub-agent that offloads Figma MCP read calls out of the main conversation, caching design payloads to `tmp/figma/`. Read-only. |
| [`pr-explainer`](plugins/pr-explainer) | command · skill | Install the AI PR-explainer GitHub Action into a repo — nag workflow + check/publish scripts, an orphan `ai-docs` branch, GitHub Pages, and a sticky 🔴/🟡/🟢 'explainer' comment + status gate linking an AI HTML walkthrough. |
| [`post-review-as-bot`](plugins/post-review-as-bot) | skill | Post a code review to a GitHub PR as inline comments attributed to a GitHub App `[bot]` account — mints an installation token, validates comments against the diff, submits one atomic review. |
| [`codex-delegation`](plugins/codex-delegation) | skills ×3 | Delegate work to Codex CLI (gpt-5.5) — `codex-implementation` (scoped changes via `codex exec`), `codex-review` (independent diff review), `codex-computer-use` (browser/simulator/screenshot verification). |
| [`questionnaire`](plugins/questionnaire) | skill | Batch 3+ clarifying questions into a local HTML form — recommended answers pre-checked, per-question comments, and a "Copy prompt" button that serializes everything into one paste-back prompt. |
| [`batch-grill-me-html`](plugins/batch-grill-me-html) | skill | Conduct a manual, dependency-aware design interview in HTML rounds — each form contains the complete current decision frontier, recommended answers, Plannotator injection, and a paste-back prompt. |
